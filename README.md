# grocerylist

This sample project is built on [Framework7](https://framework7.io/). It takes an exported XML shopping list from the [MacGourmet Deluxe](https://marinersoftware.com/product/macgourmet-deluxe/) desktop application and creates a digital list you can use on your mobile device.

## Requirements

  * Obviously, you will need to host this somewhere
  * An XML export of your shopping list. Replace mgourmet4.xml with your own export in the root folder.
